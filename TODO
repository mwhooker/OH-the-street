known issues:
    * set of stores tweets grows without bound
    * stars and random need to be implemented
    * using "since_id" to query search doesn't do what we think it does. Since
        results are not in chronological order, grabbing the last id comes from
        an arbitrary time. We should probably use 'since', and record the date
        from the last query.
        * Using since can raise a 403/404
        * keeping a running list of "Latest" tweets as they come in doesn't do
            what we want it to, as explained above. consider searching with
            result_type set to "recent".
